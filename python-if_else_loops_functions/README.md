## Why Indentation is Important

Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Unlike many other languages, Python relies on consistent indentation to determine the structure of the code, making it critical for readability and correctness. Improper indentation results in syntax errors.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```

## Using `if`, `if ... else` Statements

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. The `if ... else` statement allows you to execute one block if the condition is true and another block if it is false.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```

## Writing Comments

Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the Python interpreter. Use `#` for single-line comments or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line comments.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a multi-line comment
used to explain complex logic.
"""
```

## Variable Assignment

Variables are used to store data. You can assign values to variables using the `=` operator.

```python
x = 5
name = "Python"
```

## Loops: `while` and `for`

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code. The `while` loop runs as long as a condition is true, while the `for` loop iterates over a sequence.

```python
# while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## Controlling Loop Flow

* **`break`** is used to exit a loop prematurely.
* **`continue`** skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

## Using `else` with Loops

The `else` clause in a loop is executed when the loop completes normally (i.e., not interrupted by `break`).

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed")
```

## The `pass` Statement

The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing. It is used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.

```python
if True:
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
```

## Using `range`

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used in loops.

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Start at 1, end before 10, step by 2
    print(i)
```

## Functions in Python

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

## Function Return Behavior

If a function does not explicitly use a `return` statement, it returns `None` by default.

```python
def no_return():
    pass

print(no_return())  # Output: None
```

## Variable Scope

The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed. Variables defined inside a function have local scope, while those defined outside have global scope.

```python
x = 10  # Global scope

def my_function():
    y = 5  # Local scope
    print(y)

my_function()
print(x)
```

## Understanding Tracebacks

A traceback is an error message that shows the call stack at the point where an exception occurred. It helps in debugging.

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(e)
```

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations:

* `+` (Addition)
* `-` (Subtraction)
* `*` (Multiplication)
* `/` (Division)
* `%` (Modulus)
* `**` (Exponentiation)
* `//` (Floor Division)

```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # 13
print(a - b)  # 7
print(a * b)  # 30
print(a / b)  # 3.333...
print(a % b)  # 1
print(a ** b) # 1000
print(a // b) # 3
```
